Black Ops 2 External Console
============================

This is the source code of my free Black Ops 2 External Console.

Please read this before using this code.

All the code that is shown here is NOT written by me, because this I do not take the attribution of this code.
I just collected the code of different consoles to make a unified and working one. Below thereÂ´s a list of the different creators of the code:
- Barata: Original console and source code.
- Nukem: Words of Barata "reversing and always being helpful".
- Lovro: For coding the Dvar Unlocker.



Acknowledgements:
- Zura: For sending me the first source code I had.
- Azyx: For inspiring, helping me get started with the console and supporting me in this trip I took 5 months ago.
- And all the people who downloaded, used and gave feedback.
