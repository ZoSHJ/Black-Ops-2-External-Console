Black Ops 2 External Console
============================

This is the source code of my free Black Ops 2 External Console.

Please read this before using this code.

All the code that is shown here is NOT written by me, because this I do not take the attribution of this code.
I just collected the code of different consoles to make a unified and working one. Below thereÂ´s a list of the different creators of the code:
- Barata: Original console and source code.
- Nukem: Words of Barata "reversing and always being helpful".
- Lovro: For coding the Dvar Unlocker.

How To Use
==========

Add "BO2Console.cs" and "Stubs.cs" to the project, then call the method "SendCommand", the argument is the command that you want to send.
Every method retrieves true (if it was successfully executed) or false (if it failed executing the code), but this is not coded to the SendCommand method, you will have to code this section.

Caution
=======
The t6zm address is NOT updated and therefore it may cause a VAC ban, so please get the correct address before using the code for Black Ops 2 Zombies
